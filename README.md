## Getting Started

This project is composed of two parts: a React frontend and a Go backend. To get this project running, you will need to start both servers.

### Prerequisites

- Install Node.js and npm. You can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- Install Go. You can download it from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Installing and Running the Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

    ```
    cd server
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```
    go get
    ```

3. Run the server:

    ```
    go run .
    ```

    The server should now be running at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Installing and Running the Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

    ```
    cd client
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the server:

    ```
    npm start
    ```

    The app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`. You should be able to access it in your web browser.

## Algorithm & Approach

The application follows a client-server architecture where the React-based frontend serves as the client and a Go-based HTTP server serves as the backend.

In the frontend, the application is divided into smaller React components, each with a specific job, which promotes reusability and easier testing. For example, there is a Card component to display each password card, a NewCardForm component for creating new cards, and the App component as the root that ties everything together.

In the backend, the Go application is very simple and follows the standard net/http package layout. There are two handlers, one for the collection of password cards (/password-cards) and one for individual password cards (/password-cards/{id}). The data is stored in-memory using a map, and protected by a mutex for concurrent access.

## Assumptions and Limitations

### Assumptions:
- Each card has a unique ID generated by the server. This is assumed in the frontend when mapping over the cards to create Card components.
- The server always responds with correct data or meaningful error messages.

### Limitations:
- Passwords are stored and transmitted in plain text, which is not secure in a real-world scenario.
- Since the data is stored in-memory, it will be lost if the server restarts. In a real-world scenario, a database would be more appropriate.

## Best Practices

The code follows best practices such as:

- Use of modern syntax and language features (e.g., hooks in React, const and let in JavaScript)
- Proper indentation and formatting
- Clear naming conventions for variables and functions
- Proper use of HTTP methods and status codes in the server
- Proper error handling and propagation

## Technical Dependencies and Libraries

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Go: A statically typed, compiled programming language
- Google's UUID library: To generate unique IDs for password cards
- CORS middleware: To bypass the CORS policy in the browser

The code is written using Visual Studio Code and can be executed using standard tools for each language (go run for Go and npm start for React).
